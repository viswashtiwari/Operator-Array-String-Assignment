1. List the Operators in Java?
Answer: The operators are:-
I.Unary Operators.
Ii. Arithmetic Operators.
Iii. Shift Operators.
Iv. Bitwise Operators
v. Ternary Operators.
vi. Relational Operators
Vii. Assignment Operators.
Viii. Logical Operators.


2. Explain about Increment and Decrement operators and give an examples
Answer. Increment and Decrement operators is use to increase or decrease value of variable by 1 that is i=i+1 . Both are two type first is prefix and other is postfix there syntax are -
Increment Operators ++x / x++
Decrement Operators - -x / x–


3. What are the Conditional Operators in Java?
Answer : The conditional Operators used for combining more than one boolean expression . In other words it is used to combine two expression for example if we want to print a number which is more than 3 and less than 5 then we use conditional operator


Conditional-and operator (&&)
The operator is applied between two Boolean expressions . It is denoted by the two AND operator (&&) . It return true if and only if both expression  are true , else return false


Syntax
if(condition  1 && condition  2) {
{statement}
}


Conditional OR (||)
The operator is applied between two Boolean expressions. It is denoted by the two OR operator (||). It returns true if any of the expression is true, else returns false


Syntax


if(condition  1 || condition  2) {
{statement}
}


Ternary Operator
Ternary operator decides which value will be assigned to the variable. It is the only conditional operator that accepts three operands. It can be used instead of the if-else statement. It makes the code much more easy, readable, and shorter.




Syntax
condition? {statement - 1 : statement - 2}






4. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
Answer: There are three types of operators based on the number of operands : 
I. Unary operator
Ii. Binary Operator
Iii. Ternary Operator


5. What are the conditional Statements and use of conditional statements in Java?
if : it execute the block of code if the condition is true
else: else is execute when the condition of if is not true then else block will execute
else if : else if will execute when first condition is false
switch: there are multiple block of code if any case will true then the case will execute


6. What is the syntax of if else statement?
if(condition a){
// this code will execute if condition is true
}
else if(condition b){
// this code will execute if condition is true
}
else{
            // else block will execute if condition a and b both are false
            }




7. What are the 3 types of iterative statements in java?
Answer: 3 types of iterative statements in java are:-
1. for  loop
2. while loop
3. do-while loop


8. What do you mean by an Array?
Answer: An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. When the array is created, the length of the array will be declared 




9. How to create an Array?
Answer: There are two famous methods to create an Array 
Method 1 :-
int [] marks =new int[4];
        marks[0]=30;
        marks[1]=48;
        marks[2]=34;
        System.out.println(marks[0]); 


        Method 2:-


        int[]marks={80,3,34,55,555};
        System.out.println(marks[2]);


10. State the difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder in JavaC
Answer : Java provides three classes to represent a sequence of characters: String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder. The String class is an immutable class whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes are mutable. There are many differences between StringBuffer and StringBuilder.


StringBuffer : StringBuffer is synchronized i.e. thread safe. It means two threads can't call the methods of StringBuffer simultaneously.


StringBuffer is less efficient than StringBuilder.


StringBuilder : StringBuilder is non-synchronized i.e. not thread safe. It means two threads can call the methods of StringBuilder simultaneously.


StringBuilder is more efficient than StringBuffer.
